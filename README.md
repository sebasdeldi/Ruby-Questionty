# Ruby-Questionty
Allows the user to add questions to the questionary from the program without touching any code line, it doesn't matter if the inputs are in upcase or lowercase, also it has a "points system", if you answer correctly, you get a +1, if you answer wrong, you get a -2, at the end of the questionary you are going to get the balance of your points.
